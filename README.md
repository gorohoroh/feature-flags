This repository shows:
* The usage of common functions and event listeners from LaunchDarkly's LaunchDarklyâ€™s Node server SDK
* The usage of equivalent functions and event listeners from the OpenFeature Node.js SDK.

Use these code samples if you want to migrate from LaunchDarkly's Node server SDK to OpenFeature Node.js SDK while retaining LaunchDarkly as your feature flagging service provider.

Sample code is inspired by:
